Q.) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Ans.) when i want others also to track my file and give feedback on that.

Also, since the two branches are merged, the order in which they are typed into the command line does not 
   matter. The key is to remember that git merge always merges all the specified branches into the currently 
   checked out branch, creating a new commit for that branch
